For my final project, I want to recreate a version of the game Brick Breaker. This will include an array of blocks on the top half of the screen while a small plate is moved by the user at the bottom to bounce a ball and break the blocks. I will use Cinder to create the graphics and follow the user's movements. I plan on having a single level that the player must pass (break all the blocks on the screen) in order to win. I plan on keeping track of lives. So, if the player misses the ball and it leaves the designated screen, a life will be lost. The player will have 3 lives before they lose the game.

This game has a lot of meaning to me because I grew up playing this game and recreating it would be a really cool experience for me. I will use only the tools that we learned in class, so I should have all the resources available to me to build it properly.

By the end of Week 1, I want to have a lot of the graphics done. By Week 2, I want to get the backend working to make a functional game, and I want to work on final touches on Week 3. If I were to finish early, I would try to add more screens or levels for the player to progress through and add powerups for the player to use throughout the game.
